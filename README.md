# amazon.cn-spider
A python program which can capture and download commodity images from amazon.cn
## Introduction
Python3 is a good programming language to code short script projects, and I used *requests*, *BeautifulSoup*, *re* and *os* modules to get  commodity images from Amazon.cn(Chinese E-commerce website).
## py and exe
This repository has .py and .exe two file formats, import pyinstaller can convert .py to .exe
## Instruction
.py can let you know my ideas, .exe can run in windows os. It's easy to input the commodity items name, then find the images and .html files from c:\\test_imgs
